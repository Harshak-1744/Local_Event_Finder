# Local Event Finder

## Overview
**Local Event Finder** is a dynamic web application designed to showcase local events. Leveraging JavaScript and AJAX with `XMLHttpRequest`, it fetches event data from a JSON file and dynamically updates the webpage, demonstrating asynchronous requests, JSON parsing, and DOM manipulation.

## Features
- **Dynamic Data Fetching**: Asynchronous AJAX requests to a local JSON file for seamless user experience.
- **Event Display**: Elegantly displays details of each event (title, date, location, description).
- **Interactive UI**: Simple user interface with a button to trigger event data loading.
- **Responsive Design**: Compatibility with various devices and screen sizes.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **JavaScript (ES6)**
- **JSON**

## How It Works
- Predefined events are loaded from `events.json`.
- The "Load Events" button triggers an `XMLHttpRequest` to fetch event data.
- Data is parsed from JSON and dynamically displayed on the page.
- Implements error handling for scenarios like file not found or network errors.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Asynchronous JavaScript programming.
- AJAX with `XMLHttpRequest`.
- JSON data handling.
- DOM manipulation.
- Responsive web design.
